  <p style="font-size: 36px;">PHASE THREE/FOUR OVERVIEW</p>
  <p style="font-size: 18px;">
    In this phase, we continued developing our work and achieved our MVP! We initially ran into a major roadblock when our testing rig broke, but overcame this challenge and went on to achieve two-axis control of our rotor system’s thrust vector. 
  <br><br> </p>

  <p style="font-size: 24px;">THE EXPLOSION</p>
  
  
  <p style="font-size: 18px;">
  Much of our work during this phase was precipitated by the explosion of our test rig.
  <br>
    [pic17vid: video of explosion here]
    
  <br>

  After this breakdown of our testing rig, we discussed possible reasons for the failure. Rewatching videos of the failure of the rig, we saw significant vibrations from the rotor system being transferred to the testing rig and causing significant deformation in our 3D printed attachment pieces. 
  <br><br>
  We knew that some vibration was inherent to a swashplateless system – the acceleration and deceleration of our rotor head was what made it work, in theory. However, we seemed to be experiencing far more vibration than made sense. 
  <br><br>
  We realized that a lot of this vibration could be attributed to our rotor system. The center of gravity of our system was off-balance from our center of rotation, causing unnecessary vibration.
  <br><br>
  [pic18 - side-by-side comparison of old and new rotor systems]
  <br><br>
  After making this realization, we redesigned the rotor system so that it was perfectly symmetrical, meaning that its center of gravity would be better aligned with the center of rotation. 
  <br><br>
  In addition, our discussion of the inherent vibrations that come as part of a swashplateless rotor system helped us realize that we needed to strengthen our testing rig motor mount. We wanted force from the rotor system to be directly transferred to the testing rig so that we could more easily visualize the effects of our testing. For all of these reasons, we cut a new version of a similar, but strengthened, piece out of quarter-inch aluminum plate. 
  <br><br>

  <p style="font-size: 24px;">ACHIEVING TWO AXIS CONTROL</p>
  <br><br>
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 18px;">
    Once we had redesigned our swashplate and strengthened our testing rig, we went back to testing.  We fully achieved two-axis control! This was our initial goal for the whole project, so it felt good to achieve. 
    <br><br>
    [pic19vid - insert video of two-axis control working!!!]
    <br><br>
    Achieving two-axis control required some work and tuning from the first stage. We had to balance the rotorhead and test stand to enable us to see if roll was changing. We dealt with a full system rapid unscheduled disassembly due to rotor imbalance. This required redesign and build of the test system.

  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 24px;">HELICOPTER MECHANICAL DEVELOPMENT</p>
  <br><br>
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 18px;">
    Once we had solved our testing rig’s mechanical problems after the explosion, we began working on translating our helicopter from CAD into a real mechanical design. Our motivators in this stage were reducing part count and weight while maintaining strength. 
    <br><br>
    [pic20 - prev mount vs new mount]
    <br><br>
    With this motivation, we realized that we could integrate our main motor and electronics mount with the crossbars we were using to attach it to the side frame, reducing part count and complexity of assembly. 
    <br><br>
    At this point in the process, we also began manufacturing initial prototypes of our helicopter. We waterjetted our side frame pieces out of 16th inch aluminum plate. Initially, we intended to have significant lightweighting in our design. However, when we went to cut it, the shop staff requested that we not cut unnecessary holes, to avoid wasting grommet. For this reason, we removed all lightweighting. Even without it, the pieces still came out very light – 16th inch aluminum isn’t very heavy.
    <br><br>
    [pic21 & 22: DXF screenshot Sammy sent to Kai-Xing, then the actual thing]
    <br><br>
    Once we had printed our main plate and waterjetted our side plates, we began putting them together and figuring out sizing. We realized that we could reduce part count further and increase ease of assembly by using heat-set inserts rather than nuts for many connections of our main plate, so we remade the plate to accept headset inserts. 
    <br><br>
    We designed a mount for our tail tube out of 3D printed material, with the same basic considerations–we wanted it to be low-part-count, easy to assemble, and strong. We created a motor tail mount that was essentially a plug glued into the tail rod.
